# How it Works #

* older logs deleted after time

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Features #

* rotated a number of times before getting deleted
* allows automatic rotation, compression, removal, and mailing of log files
* each log file may be handled daily, weekly, monthly, or when it grows too large
* will not  modify  a log  multiple  times  in  one  day unless that log is based on the logâ€™s size and logrotate is being run multiple times  each day, or unless the -f or -force option is used.
